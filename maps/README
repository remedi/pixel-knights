Map file format:

<width_byte><height_byte><new_line>
<map_tile><map_tile>...width...<map_tile><new_line>
<map_tile><map_tile>...width...<map_tile><new_line>
......height.........
<map_tile><map_tile>...width...<map_tile><new_line>


Adding map to the program:

Add new number (and other things) to the switch in the beginning of maps.c:

    case <NEXT_NUMBER>:
	map_path = "../maps/<YOUR_MAP_FILE>";
	break;


Then this number can be called from client and server.



There are two example maps from which the map file format can be recapped.

Map related functions are described in maps.h
